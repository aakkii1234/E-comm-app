## THE GOAL 
As technology is developing day by day, there should have an equality among all sorts of people of getting benefits from this technology. The idea behind developing this site was to provide an online experience to visually impaired person, as well as abled person. It would be nice if a visually impaired person could buy his/her necessary products from online without any help of others. From that perspective of view, this is a very little attempt to build an e-commerce site, from where anyone can buy products by following the narrated instructions. For example, to listen about "Available Products", it is needed to say "Read" after pressing the "Ctrl" button from the keyboard, and then it will start to narrate products' names and prices. To listen about a specific item, it needs to say the product's "title" after the "Ctrl" button is pressed. <br>
<br>
The idea was proposed by Deepthy Nair, and she also proposed to add Face Recognition to authenticate the user. Applying facerecognition with JavaScript is a little bit challenging, but it can be possible. It can also be excellent to authenticate the user by Fingerprint Authentication, which was first proposed by Jaya Verma. Moreove it would be great to make the site userfriendly for those people who are Color Vision Impaired.
